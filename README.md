 Implement a Command-Line Interface (CLI) based networked distributed system for a group-based client-server communication
    Group formation, connection, and communication 
o A group should be correctly formed connecting with all members where all members can communicate without any error.

    Use of design patterns
o Adequate use of various design patterns in the implementation of the project.
    Fault tolerance 
o Adequate strategy implementation for the fault tolerance, when a member
terminates abnormally or when a coordinator terminates abnormally.
    JUnit based testing of the application 
o Desired testing for implementation of all of the main requirements.
    Use of component-based development
o Adequate design and development of components in the implementation.
